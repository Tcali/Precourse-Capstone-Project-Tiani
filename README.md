# Hello Visitors!
My name is Tiani Calip  and I’m a new data scientist curious to learn more about the day-to-day life of a Data Scientist.
A bit about me: I’m a data scientist with a background in biology, who is going through a remote online program via Thinkful to build projects in Python. I’m passionate about breaking into a company in the D.C. area, but I understand that I have a lot to learn about this new career, which is why I’m opening up the opportunity to dialogue with you here.
I am curious to find out about what my skills should look like in a real-world setting. If you have any advice or feedback on my projects, please don't hesitate to contact me!

In this GitHub repository, you can track my journey in Thinkful's Data Science course. Pay special attention to my Capstone Projects, where I spend more time displaying the techniques in a write up. They are super interesting!

Capstone 1: I talk about the correlations between different health indicators and visualize the differences between such indicators of the US and Vietnamese poopulations for the last 50 years.

Capstone 2: I predict the liklihood of dog adoption rates in an animal shelter in Austin, TX.

Capstone 3: I highlight student attributes correlated with youth alcohol consumption and identify what supervised machine learning classifier obtains the highest accuracy.

Programs/Analysis Used: Python, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, KN, PCA, for loops, different regression and classification models, and so on.
